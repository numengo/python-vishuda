"The second collection, a ``dict`` named :attr:`states`, contains the "

"define the behavior where `conversation_timeout` is exceeded, and a state "
"for`WAITING` to define behavior when a new update is received while the "
"previous ``@run_async`` decorated handler is not finished.\n"

"message is expected. You could use this for a ``/cancel`` command or to let "

"(https://docs.google.com/document/"

"\n"
"The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic]"
"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and "
"the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\n"
"expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback "
"emerges from use. In addition to our\n"
"usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), "
"feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs."

"\n"
"\n"
"While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related "
"information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP]"
"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may "
"be overlaps. The intent is to cover\n"
"the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing "
"websites during an emergency situation.\n"
"\n"
"Several kinds of information can be provided:\n"
"\n"
"We encourage the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires"
"\" (if appropriate), \"category\" and\n"
"\"url\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "
"\"category\" where possible, most ideally as a well known\n"
"URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus "
"pandemic, this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?"
"title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/"
"Q81068910\".\n"
"\n"
"For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an "
"inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, "
"provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an "
"inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a "
"property of that, alongside at least a simple \"[[text]]\" summary of the "
"page. It is\n"
"unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible "
"properties simultaneously.\n"
"\n"
"We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more "
"specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], "
"[[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] "
"you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e."
"g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the "
"[[SpecialAnnouncement]].\n"
"\n"
"Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to "
"identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, "
"and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and "
"[[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region "
"and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an "
"entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].\n"
"\n"
"The [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus "
"of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only\n"
"for representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a "
"[[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and "
"[[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the "
"initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too.\n"
"\n"
"The basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS]"
"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-"
"like information can be shared by posting\n"
"[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites "
"with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\n"
"with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline "
"[[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing\n"
"media type information, e.g. \"application/rss+xml\" or \"application/atom"
"+xml\".\n"

"Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), "
"including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface "
"landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial "
"anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other "
"medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified "
"through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial "
"anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of "
"incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an "
"underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by "
"palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the "
"humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as "
"size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of "
"surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation "
"(dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes "
"pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint "
"allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the "
"superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the "
"underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure)."
